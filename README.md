# FINDME


FINDME is a python script used in Recon to find missing people online from SAPS website. Please use the tool for security reaserch only i won't be held accountable for any illegal use of the tools.

# The Main Reason for Creating this tool.
According to *Tracelabs*, the statistics are sobering â€“ more people are going missing each year, with some falling victim to unthinkable fates like human trafficking. It's a stark reality that demands a modern, scalable solution to safeguard our society from such tragedies. However, I created  automation tool that extracts vital information from the SAPS website and presents it in a comprehensive user-friendly HTML format that can save time in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). Most missing people cases are oftenly neglected by the police Department as result of miginalization of OSINT tools in many digitaly divided continents like Africa. 



I created this tool to help Forensic Investigators, people from Tracelabs or the charleyproject to trace people efficently and get the output of Information in nice HTML Format and enhancing OSINT.
